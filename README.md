# Inspiration
As college students, our group very much understood the urge to put mental health on the back burner. Especially in a high-achieving environment, we know how easy it is to forget about caring for ourselves. Moreover, as Dartmouth students, we also understand all too well how much the weather can impact our mental health. Thus, we decided to address the prioritization of mental health with Well Buddies.

# What it does
WellBuddies was created for students to prioritize their own wellbeing. By listening to your buddy's suggestions and taking care of them, you take care of yourself. Choose between a cat, corgi dog, or a panda for your buddy. Enter in your location, and your buddy will suggest wellness activities to do based on your weather. WellBuddies suggests wellness activities for you to do, and you can check them off or add your own.

# How we built it
We used React and HTML/CSS/Javascript to build the website. We used a weather API to get weather data, Firebase to authenticate users and store wellness tasks in a database, and Figma to design the buddy illustration.

# Challenges we ran into
This was our first Hackathon, so we learned a lot. Most of us weren't familiar with React, so we challenged ourself to learn how to use React for a website with multiple components. We struggled to get the database up, and if we had more time, we would integrate it more with the checklist of wellness tasks. We also struggled to deploy the website.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned a lot about React, GitHub, and Firebase. We're proud of the original illustrations we created and how many aspects of the website we were able to create as many of our first complex React website.

# What we learned
We learned how to use states, props, and components in React and how to use an API.

# What's next for WellBuddies
We would love to build upon our website by including the ability to add friends, for you to see data and analytics about the wellness activities you complete, and more customizability in your buddy.
